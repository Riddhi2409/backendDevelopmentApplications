Given Task: You are required to create a backend web application that provides API endpoints to interact with a simple "To-Do List" application. The frontend (To-Do List app) will be built separately and will communicate with your backend through the provided API endpoints. The backend should allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks from their to-do list.

I made the backend according to the user authentication here there is two model - 1st one - user (name, email,tokenId) and 2nd one (title , description , date, email, tid(tokenId)) for the particular user.
